<div id="g.2.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gibbon DNA samples Blood samples were collected from a total of 157 indivi-duals of the following species: Agile ( 
 <i>Hylobates agilis</i> ; N = 37), Kloss ’ ( 
 <i>H. klossii</i> ; N = 2), White-handed ( 
 <i>H. lar</i> ; N = 40), Silvery Javan ( 
 <i>H. moloch</i> ; N = 6), Mueller ’ s Bor-nean gray ( 
 <i>H. muelleri</i> ; N = 6), Pileated ( 
 <i>H. pileatus</i> ; N = 19), Chinese White-cheeked ( 
 <i>Nomascus leucogenys</i> ; N = 16) and Siamang ( 
 <i>Symphalangus syndactylus</i> ; N = 31). Sampling was conducted at the Ragunan Zoo and the Pontianak Zoo in Indonesia, and the Chiang Mai Zoo, the Bangkok Zoo and the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. We also sampled gibbons reared by local resi-dents in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the DNA Microex-traction Kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) or the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany). Research permissions were granted by each country and sampling was conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Institute of Health, U.S.A. (1985) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Primates by the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University (1986, 2002). All procedures were approved by the animal ethics commit-tee of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. Among the 157 individuals, 152 were subjected to the genotyping of the L/M opsin genes (Additional file 1, Table S1). The remaining 5 individuals (two 
 <i>H. agilis</i> , one 
 <i>H. lar</i> , and two 
 <i>S. syndactylus</i> ) were included in the analysis of the neutral reference genes. Among the 152 individuals, 94 were subjected to DNA sequencing of the entire 3.6~3.9-kb region encompassing exon 3 to exon 5 (Table 1).
