<div id="g.2.3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">L opsin gene of two African hominoids, humans [18] and chimpanzees (primarily 
 <i>P. t. verus</i> ) [25]. In the present study, we focused on gibbons (Family Hylobatidae), com-monly known as the lesser apes, for which normal tri-chromacy is reported [30]. Gibbons occur in Asia and are the most diverse and speciose of all living apes [31], mak-ing them an ideal group with which to assess the range of L/M opsin genetic variation. We examined the nucleotide variation of both the L and M opsin genes by sequencing the 3.6~3.9-kb genomic region encompassing exon 3 to exon 5 from individuals in five species and three genera of gibbons.
