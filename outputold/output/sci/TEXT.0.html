First, the astrometric coincidence of the associ-ated x-ray, optical, infrared (IR), and radio tran-sient with the light centroid of the putative host galaxy is strongly indicative of a positional con-nection to an MBH ( <i>21</i> &#8211;  <i>25</i> ). Second, the observed x-ray variability time scales are consistent with those of an accreting MBH [see below and sup-porting online material (SOM)]. Last, the observed correlation between the x-ray flux and spectral hardness (SOM) is similar to that observed in blazars ( <i>26</i> ,  <i>27</i> ). Arguments against alternative interpretations are considered in the SOM. Accepting the accreting MBH hypothesis, we now examine constraints on the BH mass and the accretion characteristics. The x-ray light curve implies a minimum host-frame variability time scale of  <i>t</i> <sub>var,min </sub> &#8776;  78 s (SOM and fig. S1). By requiring ( <i>28</i> ,  <i>29</i> ) that  <i>t </i> exceed the light-crossing time of  <i>r</i> <sub>S</sub> , we de <sup>va</sup> r <sup>r</sup> i <sup>,</sup> v <sup>m</sup> e <sup>in</sup> d an upper limit on the MBH mass  <i>M </i> &#8818;  8 &#215; 10 <sup>6 </sup> <i>M </i> . Irrespective of the timing argum <sup>B</sup> e <sup>H</sup> nt, we can pl <sup>&#8857;</sup> ace approximate upper limits on the mass of the central BH if we assume that the whole mass of the galaxy [few &#215; 10 <sup>9 </sup> <i>M </i> ( <i>20</i> )] and its light [few &#215; 10 <sup>9 </sup> <i>L </i> ( <i>20</i> );  <i>L </i> , solar l <sup>&#8857;</sup> uminosity] arise from the host  <sup>&#8857;</sup> bulge (i.e <sup>&#8857; </sup> ., not in the disk) and apply the bulge mass &#8211;  BH mass and the bulge luminosity &#8211;  BH mass corre-lations ( <i>30</i> <i>&#8211; </i> <i>32</i> ). All such analyses suggest that <i>M</i> <sub>BH </sub> &#8818;  10 <sup>7 </sup> <i>M</i> <sub>&#8857; </sub> , which is securely under the limit (few &#215; 10 <sup>8 </sup> <i>M </i> ) required for the tidal disruption of a solar-ma <sup>&#8857;</sup> ss star to occur outside the event horizon of the MBH. If the emission is isotropic, the average x-ray luminosity of the outburst (SOM),  <i>L</i> <sub>x </sub> &#8776;  10 <sup>47 </sup> erg s <sup>&#8722; </sup> 1 , corresponds to the Eddington luminosity of an  &#8764;  10 <sup>9 </sup> <i>M </i> BH, which is incompatible with the upper limit <sup>&#8857; </sup> derived from variability.

We can also infer the presence of rela-tivistic outflow (SOM) by requiring that the true brightness temperature of the radio transient be less than the inverse Compton catastrophe tem-perature 10 <sup>12 </sup> K. Those constraints require a mean G <sub>j </sub> &#8819;  1.9 from  <i>t</i> <sub>0 </sub> to the time of the very long base-line interferometry (VLBI) observations reported in ( <i>20</i> ). Separately, we can use the observed var-iability of the radio counterpart to place con-straints on the source size, finding  G <sub>j </sub> &#8819;  10. If the source had been active in the distant past, we would expect to observe extended radio emission (such as jets or other emission knots) in VLBI imaging. Because this was not seen ( <i>20</i> ) and archival searches spanning two decades have yielded no evidence for prior AGN activity from radio to gamma-ray wavebands (SOM), the evidence thus suggests that an  <i>M</i> <sub>BH </sub> = 10 <sup>6 </sup> to www.sciencemag.org  SCIENCE  VOL 333 8 JULY 2011 203 <div><img src="../../../target/output/sci/image.g.3.0.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/sci/image.g.3.0.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>REPORTS near-Eddington accretion rates, launching an energetic relativistic outflow in the process. This rapid increase in the accretion rate cannot result from gas entering the sphere of influence (soi) of the MBH, because this would require a time scale &#8764;  <i>R </i> / s  &#8819;  10 <sup>4 </sup> year to appreciably alter the accre-tion <sup>so</sup> r <sup>i</sup> ate near the horizon, where  <i>R </i> &#8764;  1 pc is the radius of the sphere of influence an <sup>so</sup> d <sup>i </sup> s  &#8764;  100 km s <sup>&#8722; </sup> 1  is a typical bulge velocity dispersion. We sug-gest instead that a TDF provides a natural ex-planation for Sw 1644+57. The observed x-ray fluence  <i>S</i> <sub>x </sub> suggests an energy release of  <i>E </i> = 1.6 &#215; 10 <sup>53 </sup> <i>f </i> erg for the first  &#8764;  50 days. Assum <sup>x </sup> ing that the ene <sup>b</sup> rgy released in the XRT band is about one-third of the bolo-metric energy (Fig. 1) and adopting  <i>f </i> = 5 &#215; 10 <sup>&#8722; </sup> 3 , the total energy release from the jet <sup>b</sup> amounts to 0.3% of the maximum available mass energy to be accreted if  <i>M</i> <sub>* </sub> =  <i>M</i> <sub>&#8857; </sub> . Given a typical accretion efficiency of  <i>D </i> &#8801;  <i>E </i> / <i>m c</i> <sup>2 </sup> = 0.1 ( <i>m </i> , ac-creted mass), th <sup>B</sup> e <sup>H</sup> jet nee <sup>av</sup> d rad <sup>ac</sup> i <sup>c</sup> ate only about <sup>a</sup> 1 <sup>cc</sup> /30th of the available energy  <i>E </i> ; if mass is lost during the circularization phase <sup>av</sup> or to subsequent disk winds, then the required jet efficiency must be higher. The duration of the x-ray light curve and the requisite accretion rate are also broadly compatible with the several-day fallback time scale (SOM). The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of Sw 1644+57 (Fig. 1) displays two peaks, at far-IR and at x-ray/gamma-ray wavebands. Ther-mal emission from the disk or accretion-powered outflows ( <i>9</i> ,  <i>10</i> ) do not naturally account for ei-ther component. Instead, the overall spectral shape is reminiscent of blazars, for which the peaks at low and high energies are typically modeled as synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission, respectively. The x-ray emission shows both a bright/flaring and a dim/slower-varying ( &#8220;  qui-escent &#8221;  ) state. Under the TDF hypothesis, what could account for the observed spectrum and temporal behavior? Possibilities are as follows: 1) Single-component synchrotron with dust extinction. In low-luminosity BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, the synchrotron spectral peak ( n <i>F </i> ; with specific flux density  <i>F </i> at frequency  n ) m <sup>n</sup> ay oc-cur at energies as high <sup>n</sup> as hard x-rays. Thus, one possibility is that the entire emission, from radio to x-rays, is part of a single nonthermal syn-chrotron spectrum originating from shocked rel-ativistic electrons. In this scenario, the suppressed optical emission and red IR colors of the transient could result from dust extinction in the visible-light V band ( <i>A </i> ) &gt; 10 mag. Thus, although a single extinguish <sup>V</sup> ed synchrotron spectrum can-not be ruled out, the large required extinction may disfavor this interpretation (fig. S3). Fur-thermore, although a synchrotron origin is still likely for at least the radio emission, there is evidence that the radio- and x-ray &#8211;  emitting re-gions may not be spatially coincident (SOM). 2) Two-component blazar emission. The far-IR and hard x-ray peaks may, instead, represent distinct spectral components, corresponding to synchrotron and IC emission, respectively, as in blazars (SOM and fig. S3). The  n <i>F </i> luminos-ity of the low-energy peak is  &#8764;  1 to 2 <sup>n </sup> orders of magnitude weaker than that of the high-energy peak (Fig. 1). This extreme ratio and the rela-tively low frequency of the synchrotron peak are both compatible with Eddington-accreting blazar emission ( <i>5</i> ). 3) Forward shock emission from jet &#8211;  interstellar medium interaction. Although the above models generally assume that the low- and high-energy spectral components are directly related, evidence suggests that they may originate from distinct radii, at least during the x-ray flaring state. Although the rapid variability of the x-ray emission strongly indicates an  &#8220;  internal &#8221;  origin ( <i>33</i> ), the radio-IR emission varies more smoothly and could in-stead result at larger radii from the interaction of the jet with the surrounding interstellar medium (SOM). If no AGN activity occurred before the recent onset of emission, the jet must burrow its way through the gas in the nuclear region ( <i>34</i> ). Because of its fast motion, the newly formed jet drives a shock into the external gas (forward shock), while simultaneously a reverse shock slows it down. Particles accelerated at these shocks may power synchrotron afterglow emis-sion beginning simultaneously when the jet forms, yet lasting long after the internal emission has faded. This model, the geometry of which is de-picted in Fig. 2, appears to best accommodate the data and predicts the long-term evolution of the radio and IR transient (SOM). No rising UV-optical transient nor slowly evolving thermal x-ray component has been seen to date from Sw 1644+57, in contrast with the nominal expectations of TDFs. However, if Sw 1644+57 was obscured by dust, then UV-optical suppression of the transient would be expected. And if we understand the thermal x-ray emission as being outshone by the jetted emission in the first weeks, the thermal component may emerge on a time scale of months. For this to occur, the jet emission must be quenched due, for example, <div><img src="../../../target/output/sci/image.g.3.5.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/sci/image.g.3.5.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>204 8 JULY 2011 VOL 333  SCIENCE  www.sciencemag.org <div><img src="../../../target/output/sci/image.g.4.1.png" width="20%"/><a href="../../../target/output/sci/image.g.4.1.svg" target="separate">SVG</a></div>8.

The Eddington accretion rate is a theoretical upper limit to spherical mass accretion, whereby mass inflow due to gravitation attraction to a central source is balanced by radiation pressure from that source. Super-Eddington luminosities are possible when mass accretion is not homogeneous, spherical, and/or the main source of emission near the radiation source is not in the form of photons (for example, neutrinos).

As in gamma-ray burst light curves, even in the presence of relativistic motion, the observed variability should track that of the energy injection time scales from the central engine. Shorter time scale variability could, however, result from compact emitting regions moving fast within the jet ( <i>29</i> ). 29. D. Giannios, D. A. Uzdensky, M. C. Begelman,  <i>Mon. Not.</i> <i>R.

This situation is not encountered in normal (long-lived) blazars because a large  &#8819;  kiloparsec-scale cavity has been carved by the preceding outflow. 35. Here the departure from the blazar analogy is worth noting, in that the physics of the radio emission is likely to be different in this case: We have suggested that the emission is originating from the shocked surrounding material (forward shock), not the shocked jet as in normal blazars, which could contain large-scale fields. Even so, only 10% of flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects have polarization larger than our VLBI limits ( <i>36</i> ). 36. M. F. Aller, H. D. Aller, P. A. Hughes,  <i>Astrophys.

The uncertain relative contributions of the host galaxy and the optical/IR transient result in very large uncertainties for the  <i>J </i> and  <i>z </i> photometric data points. In this model, the radio and IR emission are produced by synchrotron radiation from an extended source, whereas the x-ray emission is dominated by the Compton scattering of external photons from the accretion disk (for illustrative purposes, we assume a 10 <sup>6 </sup> <i>M</i> <sub>&#664; </sub> MBH). As in the orange model, the x-ray emission is dominated by external Compton scattering, whereas the peak at high energies results from synchrotron self-Compton emission. An additional synchrotron component from a mildly relativistic blast-wave afterglow at larger radius is invoked to explain the bright radio and millimeter fluxes. </li><li>42. S. Campana, L.
