Again, we witnessed the expected<span> </span></span><span>pattern of a significant negative relationship between<span> </span></span><span><i>t</i><span> </span></span><span><sub>KCN </sub><span> </span></span><span>and the SDs (a quadratic fit, <span> </span></span><span><i>F</i><span> </span></span><span><sub>[2,4] </sub><span> </span></span><span>= 9.91, <span> </span></span><span><i>p </i><span> </span></span><span>=<span> </span></span><span>CVs (a quadratic fit, <span> </span></span><span><i>F</i><span> </span></span><span><sub>[2,4] </sub><span> </span></span><span>= 16.03, <span> </span></span><span><i>p </i><span> </span></span><span>= 0.0282, adjusted<span> </span></span><span><i>R</i><span> </span></span><span><sup>2 </sup><span> </span></span><span>= 0.834). These results showed that the later in time<span> </span></span><span>KCN was added, the less variation there was in indivi-</span><span>dual lysis times. In fact, the lowest SD (1.45 min) and<span> </span></span><span>lowest CV (2.53%) were observed when KCN was added<span> </span></span><span>55 min after induction. This was a significant two-fold<span> </span></span><span>reduction in the SD when compared normal lysis condi-</span><span>tions (see Table 1 for strain IN56 with the SD = 3.24<span> </span></span><span>min; Student<span> </span></span><span><b>â€™</b><span> </span></span><span>s <span> </span></span><span><i>t </i><span> </span></span><span>= 15.45, <span> </span></span><span><i>p </i><span> </span></span><span>&lt; 0.0001, using the standard<span> </span></span><span>deviation for the SD in Box 7.1 of [56]). This observa-</span><span>tion indicated that individual triggering for hole forma-</span><span>tion during the normal progression of cell lysis was<span> </span></span><span>relatively asynchronous when compared to the artificial<span> </span></span><span>method of acute triggering by KCN addition.</span><span>Similar to the effect of growth rate, a linear regression<span> </span></span><span>of the SDs (<span> </span></span><span><i>F</i><span> </span></span><span><sub>[1,5] </sub><span> </span></span><span>= 0.60, <span> </span></span><span><i>p </i><span> </span></span><span>= 0.4726) or CVs (<span> </span></span><span><i>F</i><span> </span></span><span><sub>[1,5] </sub><span> </span></span><span>=<span> </span></span><span>0.328, <span> </span></span><span><i>p </i><span> </span></span><span>= 0.5917) against the MLTs did not yield signif-</span><span>icant result. Another interesting aspect of the relation-</span><span>ship between <span> </span></span><span><i>t</i><span> </span></span><span><sub>KCN </sub><span> </span></span><span>and the lysis time SDs is that the<span> </span></span><span>SDs drop precipitously when KCN is added about 35<span> </span></span><span>min after induction. This observation suggests that,<span> </span></span><span>approximately 35 min after thermal induction, the<span> </span></span><span>majority of the lysogenic cells have accumulated enough<span> </span></span><span>holin proteins in the cell membrane to form holes<span> </span></span><span>immediately if triggered.</span></div>
