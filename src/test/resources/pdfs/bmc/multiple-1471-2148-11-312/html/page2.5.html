 <span>Gibbon DNA samples

 </span>
 <span>Blood samples were collected from a total of 157 indivi-</span>

 <span>Sampling was conducted at the Ragunan Zoo and the
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Pontianak Zoo in Indonesia, and the Chiang M ai Zoo,
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>the Bangkok Zoo and the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Thailand. We also sampled gibbons reared by local resi-</span>
 <span>dents in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Genomic DNA was
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>extracted from blood samples using the DNA Microex-</span>
 <span>traction Kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) or the QIAamp
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>DNA Blood M ini Kit (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany).</span>
 <span>Research permissions were granted by each country and
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>sampling was conducted according to the Guide for the
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Institute of Health, U.S.A. (1985) and the Guide for the
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Care and Use of Laboratory Primates by the Primate
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Research Institute, Kyoto University (1986, 2002). All
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>procedures were approved by the animal ethics commit-</span>
 <span>tee of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University.</span>
 <span>Among the 157 individuals, 152 were subjected to the
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>genotyping of the L/ M opsin genes (Additional file 1,
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>Table S1). The remaining 5 individuals (two

  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>analysis of the neutral reference genes. Among the 152
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>individuals, 94 were subjected to DNA sequencing of the

 <span>entire 3.6~3.9-kb region encompassing exon 3 to exon 5
