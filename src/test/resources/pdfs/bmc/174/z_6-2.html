 <p>triggers lysis [45]. Without a constant supply of ATP, the production of holin protein would also be terminated. If KCN is added soon after thermal induction of the lysogen culture, few holin proteins would have been made before the termination of holin production. Consequently, it should take a longer time for the holin proteins in the membrane to transition from a diffused state to aggregated rafts. Therefore, after the cessation of holin production by KCN addition, it may take a longer time, on average, before any lysis events are observed. On the other hand, if KCN is added late, a larger proportion of the thermally-induced lysogenic cells should have accumulated enough holin proteins in the cell membrane such that they could be triggered to form holin holes quickly. That is, the addition of KCN should prompt the rapid formation of holin holes, thus resulting in an almost immediate and synchronous lysis of most of the cells in the population. Based on the aforementioned scenarios, we expected that (1) the time delay between the time of KCN addition (

  <i>t</i>
  <sub>L</sub>) (
  <i>i.e.</i>, 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>L</sub>- 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>KCN</sub>) would be negatively correlated with the timing of KCN addition, and (2) 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>KCN</sub>would be negatively correlated with lysis

 <p>time stochasticity. Figure 4A shows a significant negative relationship between 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>L</sub>- 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>KCN</sub>and 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>KCN</sub>. As KCN was added later in time (
  <i>i. e.</i>, closer to the normal lysis time of 65.1 min), the time delay between addition of KCN and the MLT was reduced (a quadratic fit,

  <i>i.e.</i>, 10 min before the normal MLT), the time delay was only 2.6 min, almost instantaneous when compared to the 2 min sampling rate of the sipperequipped spectrophotometer method of lysis time determination [46]. Interestingly, a theoretical study of lysis time stochasticity by Ryan and Rutenberg also showed a
