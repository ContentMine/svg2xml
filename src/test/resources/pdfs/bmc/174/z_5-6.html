 <p>medium (DM) with 20 mM glucose, and DM with 40 mM glycerol, resulting in growth rates of 1.01 ± 0.07, 0.93 ± 0.05, 0.49 ± 0.04, and 0.35 ± 0.01 h
  <sup>-1</sup>(mean ± 95% confidence limits), respectively (see Table 2). As shown in Figure 3D, lower growth rates led to increased lysis time SDs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,2]</sub>= 24.50, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.0385) and CVs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,2]</sub>
 </p>
 <p>= 46.24, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.0209). A similar negative relationship was
 </p>
 <p>also apparent for the MLTs. However, because of the</p>
 <p>case of the LB medium, in which the higher growth rate</p>
 <p>actually resulted in a slightly longer MLT, the observed</p>
 <p>negative relationship was not significant (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,2]</sub>= 6.44, 
  <i>p</i>
 </p>
 <p>= 0.1265). Interestingly, neither the SDs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,2]</sub>= 16.11, 
  <i>p = 0.0568) nor the CVs (</i>
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,2]</sub>= 6.04, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.133) was sig-
 </p>
 <p>nificantly associated with the MLTs.</p>
