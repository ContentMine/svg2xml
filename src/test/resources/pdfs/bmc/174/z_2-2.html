 <p>The lytic pathway of phage λ is commonly divided into the early, delayed early, and late phases. Transitions between stages are triggered by well-characterized molecular actions involving gene transcription and translation [36]. Consequently, the timing of when individual cells enter each phase greatly influences the length of individual lysis times. A recent study by Amir 
  <i>et al.</i> [10] showed that 69% of the total lysis time variance is due to variation in the time interval between the onset of the

  <i> </i>(see
  <i> </i>APPENDIX A). This observation suggests that a large portion of the observed lysis time stochasticity is a 
  <i>de novo</i> phenomenon, confined to the production and accumulation of holin proteins in the cell membrane, rather than a direct carryover from the various upstream stochastic events.

 <p>The formation of the λ holin hole in the membrane is hypothesized to be a multi-step process that starts with the transcription of the late mRNA and the translation of the S holin protein. The resulting holin monomers are then inserted into the cell membrane, where they dimerize, then oligomerize [37], eventually leading to the formation of higher-order holin aggregates, or rafts, in the cell membrane. At a time that is specific to the holin protein sequence, the holin rafts are transformed into a membrane lesion(s) &gt; 300 nm across [38], which is large enough for the passage of a 500 KDa protein [28,29]. Lysis ensues after endolysin digests the peptidoglycan. Thus, by</p>
