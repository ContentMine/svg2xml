 <p>The effects of 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>KCN</sub>on lysis time SDs and CVs are shown in Figure 4B. Again, we witnessed the expected pattern of a significant negative relationship between t
  <sub>KCN</sub>and the SDs (a quadratic fit, 
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[2,4]</sub>= 9.91, 
  <i>p</i> = CVs (a quadratic fit, 
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[2,4]</sub>= 16.03, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.0282, adjusted R
  <sup>2</sup>= 0.834). These results showed that the later in time KCN was added, the less variation there was in individual lysis times. In fact, the lowest SD (1.45 min) and lowest CV (2.53%) were observed when KCN was added 55 min after induction. This was a significant two-fold reduction in the SD when compared normal lysis conditions (see Table 1 for strain IN56 with the SD = 3.24 min; Studentâ€™ s 
  <i>t</i> = 15.45, 
  <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001, using the standard deviation for the SD in Box 7.1 of [56]). This observation indicated that individual triggering for hole formation during the normal progression of cell lysis was relatively asynchronous when compared to the artificial method of acute triggering by KCN addition. Similar to the effect of growth rate, a linear regression

 <p>of the SDs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,5]</sub>= 0.60, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.4726) or CVs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,5]</sub>= 0.328, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.5917) against the MLTs did not yield significant result. Another interesting aspect of the relationship between 
  <i>t</i>
  <sub>KCN</sub>and the lysis time SDs is that the SDs drop precipitously when KCN is added about 35 min after induction. This observation suggests that, approximately 35 min after thermal induction, the majority of the lysogenic cells have accumulated enough holin proteins in the cell membrane to form holes immediately if triggered.
