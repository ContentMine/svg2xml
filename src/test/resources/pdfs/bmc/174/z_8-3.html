 <p>Evolutionary implication of lysis time stochasticity Both theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated the importance of lysis timing on phage fitness [46,57-61]. However, it is not clear if lysis time stochasticity would have any impact on phage fitness. All else being equal, genotypes with reduced variances in offspring number would, in the long run, have higher fitness than genotypes that have the same mean offspring number, but larger variances [62,63]. Overall, this suggests that natural selection would tend to minimize stochasticity in phenotypes that are closely linked to Darwinian fitness. If the phage burst size is positively linked with the lysis time, as has been shown previously [46], then selection for reduced burst size stochasticity should lead to reduced lysis time stochasticity as well. Presumably, this hypothesis can be tested by competing two isogenic phage strains that have the same MLTs but very different lysis time SDs. Interestingly, inspection of Table 1 revealed that mutations introduced into WT Î» holin sequence usually result in increased stochasticity, except in one case. It is not clear if this observation implies that the WT holin sequences have already been selected for reduced stochasticity in the wild as well. Experiments with more phage holins should provide some hints in this respect.</p>
