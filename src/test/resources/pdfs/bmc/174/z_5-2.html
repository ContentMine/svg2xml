 <p>between MLT and another commonly used measure of stochasticity, the coefficient of variation (CV, defined as SD/MLT; [15,25,48,49]) (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,12]</sub>= 1.50, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.2445), indicating a proportional increase of the SD with the MLT. Figure 3A also reveals a relatively scattered relationship between the MLTs and the SDs (adjusted 
  <i>R</i>
  <sup>2</sup>= 0.363), with several instances in which strains with similar MLTs are accompanied by very different SDs. For example, the mean lysis times for IN56 and IN71 were 65.1 and 68.8 min, but the SDs were 3.2 and 7.7 min, respectively. Apparently the observed positive relationship is only a general trend, not an absolute. The scattering of the plot also suggests that different missense mutations in the holin sequence can influence MLT and SD somewhat independently.
