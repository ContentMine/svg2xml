 <p>Effect of energy poison KCN It is well known that addition of the energy poison, KCN, to induced lysogen cultures will accelerate the onset of lysis [44]. Our results also confirmed this observation (see Table 2). However, it is not clear how this accelerated lysis would affect the lysis time stochasticity. From anecdotal observations, the addition of KCN seems to synchronize lysis, thus resulting in a precipitous decline of lysogen culture turbidity. Our study showed that the timing of KCN addition was inversely related to lysis time stochasticity (see Figure 4B). In fact, the smallest SD (1.45 min) was achieved by adding KCN at 55 min after thermal induction (see Table 2), a time where normally only about 1% of the cells have lysed. The almost synchronous lysis when KCN was added 55 min post thermal induction suggests that most cells would have already accumulated enough holin proteins</p>
 <p>in the cell membrane to form a hole. Besides collapsing the PMF, the addition of KCN should also halt the production of holin protein, thus “ fixes” the amount of holin proteins on the cell membrane at the time of addition. The progressive decline in lysis time</p>
