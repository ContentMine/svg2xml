 <p>Manipulation of holin protein sequence Barring potential post-translational modifications due to differences in holin protein sequence (
  <i>e.g.</i>, differential rate in proteolysis), isogenic Î» strains expressing different holin sequences would have a similar average rate of holin accumulation in the membrane and consequently the same distribution of holin proteins among the cells across different lysogen populations. That is, at any given moment, we would expect a certain proportion of cells to accumulate a certain number of holin molecules in the membrane, irrespective of the holin sequences. The observed differences in MLTs, as the result of differences in holin sequence, can be seen as a reflection of different set-points for critical concentrations in an increasingly crowded cell membrane [40]. Presumably, a sequence with a lower set-point would not only result in a shorter MLT, but also a smaller SD as well. However, the existence of similar MLTs, but very different SDs, suggests that missense mutations in the holin sequence not only affect the set-point for spontaneous triggering, but also impact the robustness of the setpoint. For example, some mutations may be relatively insensitive to the critical holin concentration, thus resulting in proportionally more cells that are triggered earlier and later than expected, hence greater lysis time stochasticity.
