 <p>Determination of lysogen growth rate Lysogen growth rate was manipulated by using different growth medium formulations: (i) full-strength LB (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl per L dH
  <sub>2</sub>O), (ii) one-fifth-strength LB (2 g tryptone, 1 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl per L dH
  <sub>2</sub>O), (iii) 20 mM glucose in Davis minimal salts (7 g K
  <sub>2</sub>HPO
  <sub>4</sub>, 2 g KH
  <sub>2</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub>, 1 g (NH
  <sub>4</sub>)
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub>, 0.5 g sodium citrate• 2H
  <sub>2</sub>O, and 0.2 g MgSO
  <sub>4</sub>• 7H
  <sub>2</sub>O), and (iv) 40 mM glycerol in Davis minimal salts. We assessed the growth of the lysogen strain IN56 by culturing it overnight at 30°C in each growth media. The next day, 90 μ L of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 25 mL growth medium and the culture was placed in a 30°C waterbath shaker at 220 rpm. Culture growth was followed
 </p>
 <p>with a sipper-equipped spectrophotometer at A . 550 The growth rate was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of natural-logarithm transformed A 550 values over time.</p>
