 <p>Because of their simplicity and ease of manipulation, phages are excellent models to explore the life history consequences of molecular stochasticity. Many phages use a “ holin-endolysin” system to compromise two physical barriers, the cell membrane and the peptidoglycan layer, in order to lyse an infected host cell [26,27]. Although there are some variations on the theme, holin usually forms a hole(s) in the inner membrane, thus either allowing soluble endolysin into the periplasmic space [28,29] or activating the membrane-tethered endolysin already translocated to the periplasm [30-32]. Endolysin then digests the peptidoglycan, causing host cell lysis.</p>
 <p>The most extensively studied lysis system is that of phage l, which consists of four genes: 
  <i>S</i> (encodes holin and antiholin), 
  <i>R</i> (encodes endolysin), 
  <i>Rz</i>, and 
  <i>Rz1 (encode an integral inner membrane protein and an outer membrane lipoprotein, respectively). All genes are co-transcribed from the late promoter </i>
