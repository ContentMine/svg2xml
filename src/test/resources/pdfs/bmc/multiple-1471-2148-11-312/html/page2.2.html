 <span>corresponding sequence of the other, thistype of recombi-</span>
 <span>nation isoften called gene conversion. Gene conversion is
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>suggested to have occurred frequently between the human
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>L and M opsin genes[11-15] and to have played a crucial
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>role in generating hybrids of the two genes with altered
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>spectral sensitivities[16-18]. Even among individualswith
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>normal color vision, the allele frequency of the L opsin
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>gene with Ala at the site 180 instead of Ser isreported to
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>be 30-38%in non-African populations[16-18].</span>
 <span>Compared to humans, the incidence of color vision
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>variation is reported to be rare in other catarrhines
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>[19-21]. Among 744 male long-tailed macaques(
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>
  <i>Macaca</i>
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>
  <i>fascicularis</i>
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>) examined, only three were found to have a
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>single L/ M hybrid gene with an intermediate spectral
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>sensitivity and to be dichromats [19,22,23]. Among 58
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>male chimpanzees (
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>
  <i>Pan troglodytes</i>
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>), one was found to
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>have an L/M hybrid gene with an intermediate spectral
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>sensitivity in addition to one normal M opsin gene on
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>the X chromosome and to be a protanomalous trichro-</span>
 <span>mat [21,24]. Thus, frequencies of color vision variants in
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>male long-tailed macaquesand male chimpanzeescan be
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>calculated to be ~0.4% and ~1.7%, respectively. These
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>frequencies could be overestimated because no variants
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>were found in 455 male monkeys from other macaque
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>species [19,23] and because the chimpanzees examined
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>were from limited numbers of breeding colonies [21].</span>
 <span>Other studies have reported an absence of color vision
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>defectsin Old World monkeysand apes[20,25].</span>
 <span>Nevertheless, gene conversion is suggested to have
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>occurred frequently between the L and M opsin genes in
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>non-human catarrhines on the basis of the following
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>observations: (1) the intraspecific nucleotide divergence
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>between the L and M opsin genes(paralogousdivergence)
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>tends to be smaller than divergence of the same gene
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>between species(orthologousdivergence) [26,27], (2) alle-</span>
 <span>lic polymorphism is often shared between L and M opsin
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>genesand between species[28,29], (3) paralogousnucleo-</span>
 <span>tide divergence in introns and peripheral exons (exons 1
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>and 6) is significantly smaller than those in the centrally
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>located exons (exons 2-5), which contain the amino acid
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>sitesaffecting absorption spectra of the L and M photopig-</span>
 <span>ments[13,14]. These studiessuggest that gene conversions
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>at nucleotide sites relevant for the spectral difference
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>between the L and M opsins have been effectively elimi-</span>
 <span>nated from the population by purifying natural selection.</span>
 <span>If gene conversion occurred frequently between the L
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>and M opsin genes and if purifying selection was active
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>in non-human catarrhines, we would also expect another
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>intraspecific pattern of nucleotide variation: higher
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>nucleotide divergence between the L and M opsin genes
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>in central exons than in introns in addition to lower
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>nucleotide diversity within these exons than within
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>introns. However, the within-speciesnucleotide variation
  <span> </span>
 </span>
 <span>of both exonsand intronshasbeen evaluated for only the
