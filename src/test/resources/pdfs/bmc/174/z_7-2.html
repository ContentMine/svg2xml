 <p>a critical concentration of holin proteins is reached in the cell membrane [40] (Figure 1, dark arrows). According to this model, any factor that influences the holin protein production should also affect the timing of lysis. Furthermore, the realized rate of holin production in each cell should also be subjected to stochastic influences impacting the various upstream biochemical reactions, such as gene transcription and translation, that lead to holin production. As has been shown by others, the lower the average rates of the biochemical reactions, the more prominent the cell-to-cell variation is [51,52].</p>
