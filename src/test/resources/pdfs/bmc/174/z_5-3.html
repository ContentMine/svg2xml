  <i> </i>the late stage of the λ lytic development [36]. Since the major determinant of lysis time is thought to be when a critical holin concentration is reached in the cell membrane [40], reduced promoter activity should not only lengthen the lysis time, as shown in a previous study [50], but should also increase the lysis time stochasticity

  <i>’ </i>activity,
  <i> </i>and
  <i> </i>the
  <i> </i>MLTs, SDs, and CVs. However, the increase of the 
  <i>p</i>
  <sub>
   <i>R</i>
  </sub>
  <i>’ </i>activity had a diminishing influence on both the MLTs, as has been shown previously [50], and the associated SDs and CVs (see Table 2). Interestingly, linear regressions (Figure 3C) showed a much tighter, positive relationship between the MLTs and the SDs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,3]</sub>= 81.04, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.0029; adjusted 
  <i>R</i>
  <sup>
   <i>2</i>
  </sup>= 0.952; 
  <i>y</i> = -15.7 + 0.3
  <i>x</i>) and a significant positive relationship between the MLTs and CVs (
  <i>F</i>
  <sub>[1,3]</sub>= 14.51, 
  <i>p</i> = 0.0318, result not shown in the figure). That is, for the WT 
  <i>S</i> gene, every 1 minute increase in the MLT corresponds to 0.3 minute increase in lysis time stochasticity.
