  <b>Conclusions Even in a seemingly uniform environment, the lysis time</b>
 </p>
 <p>can vary greatly among individual λ lysogenic cells (lysis</p>
 <p>time stochasticity). The extent of stochasticity, as quan-</p>
 <p>tified by the standard deviation, depends on the quality</p>
 <p>(due to isogenic λ lysogens expressing different S pro-</p>
 <p>tein alleles) and quantity (manipulated by having differ-</p>
