 <p>Effect of allelic variation in holin sequence It has long been known that different holin alleles show different lysis times [37,46,47]. However, it is not clear to what extent allelic differences in holin protein would affect the lysis timing of individual cells. To gain further insight, we determined the MLTs (mean lysis times) and SDs (standard deviations) of lysis time for 14 isogenic l lysogens differing in their 
  <i>S</i> holin sequences (see APPENDIX B for our rationale for using SD as the measure for lysis time stochasticity). The directly observed MLTs (Table 1) were longer than those reported previously [46]. This discrepancy was mainly due to the fact that, in previous work, lysis time was defined by the time point when the turbidity of the lysogen culture began to decline, whereas in our current measurement, it was the mean of all individual lysis times observed for a particular phage strain. Figure 3A revealed a significant positive relationship

  <i>F = 8.42, </i>
  <i>p</i> = 0.0133). How[1,12] ever, we did not observe a significant relationship
