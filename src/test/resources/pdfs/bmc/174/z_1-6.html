  <b>Background Some phenotypic variation arises from randomness in cellular processes despite identical environments and genotypes [1-9]. Population heterogeneity, resulting from such molecular stochasticity, has been documented in many microbial organisms including bacteriophage (phage) Î» [10-13], </b>
  <i>Escherichia coli</i> [14-16], 
  <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>[17,18]
  <i> </i>and
  <i> Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>[19-24].
  <i> </i>This within-population variation can have far reaching life history consequences. For example, experimentally reducing noise in the expression of ComK decreased the number of competent 
  <i>B. subtilis</i> cells in one study [18]. In another study, mutants of 
  <i>S. cerevisiae</i> showing greater heterogeneity in survival had higher rates of occasional-cell survival during high stress conditions than did wild-type cells [25].
