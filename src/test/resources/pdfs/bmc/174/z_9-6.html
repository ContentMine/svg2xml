 <p>the same dual channel heater controller to maintain the desired temperature. The internal temperature of the perfusion chamber was independently monitored by a thermistor. Waste flowed out of the perfusion chamber, pooled in a reservoir, and was siphoned into a 2 L bottle by a vacuum source. Both the perfusion chamber and the heating platform were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (TS100, Nikon) for observation at 400× magnification. One of the microscope’ s ocular lenses was replaced with a 10X MiniVID™ microscope camera (LW Scientific, Norcross, GA) to record individual lysis events onto a laptop computer at the rate of 1 frame per second. All data were collected in unit of seconds, though the results were presented in minutes.</p>
