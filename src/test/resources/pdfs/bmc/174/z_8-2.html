 <p>stochasticity as KCN was added later in time (see Figure 4B) strongly suggests that a larger supply of holin protein is a key factor in ensuring synchronous lysis. As more holin proteins are inserted into the cell membrane, the kinetics of raft formation gradually shifts from stochastic to deterministic and synchronous. In fact, there was a nearly five-fold decrease in lysis time stochasticity when the PMF was collapsed at 55 min after lysogen induction when compared to collapse at 25 min (see Table 2). It is also noted that the properties of the normally triggered and the prematurely triggered holin holes are quite distinct, with the prematurely triggered holes being much smaller than the normally triggered holes [28].</p>
