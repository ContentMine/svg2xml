  <b>Results Using a microscope-mounted, temperature-controlled perfusion chamber, we observed and recorded individual lysis events of thermally-induced </b>
  <i>Escherichia coli</i> l lysogens (Figure 2A). These observations revealed a considerable amount of variation in lysis time for the wildtype (WT) λ phage (Table 1; Figure 2B). Although the mean lysis time for the WT λ phage was 65.1 min, lysis times for individual lysogenic cells ranged from 45.4 to 74.5 min. Given that phage progeny accumulate linearly at ~7.7 phage per minute beginning ~28 min after lysis induction [46], the ~30 min range of lysis times could result in a three-fold difference in burst size between phages that lyse early and those that lyse late. This result motivated further exploration of variation in lysis time among other λ strains.
