 <p>implemented in MacOS operating system. For each lysogen strain or experimental treatment, the means and standard deviations (SDs) were extracted from the data set according to the date the data were collected and were treated as replicates. Pairwise comparisons of the means (using the Tukey-Kramer HSD test) showed that, for more than half of the cases, at least one mean was significantly different from the others. Since we were mainly interested in the variation, we subsequently converted all values into their corresponding residuals (centered by their corresponding means). We also tested the homogeneity of variance from each date replicate, using O’ Brien’ s test, Brown-Forsythe test, Levene’ s test, and Bartlett’ s test, all implemented in</p>
 <p>JMP. Not surprisingly, more than half of the cases</p>
 <p>showed that at least one replicate variance was signifi-</p>
 <p>cantly different from the others. Although we did not</p>
 <p>have an 
  <i>a priori</i> expectation of lysis time distribution,
 </p>
 <p>we nonetheless tested to see if the lysis time in each</p>
 <p>replicate is normally distributed or not, using the Sha-</p>
 <p>piro-Wilk W test. Again, in many cases, the replicates</p>
 <p>do not show a normal distribution. Despite variability</p>
 <p>in our data set, none of our conclusions were funda-</p>
 <p>mentally changed. Therefore, for the presented results,</p>
 <p>the mean and standard deviation for each lysogen</p>
 <p>strain or experimental treatment were calculated based</p>
 <p>on the following criteria: (
  <i>i</i>) if the means and variances
 </p>
 <p>were the same among all blocks, then all the data</p>
 <p>would be pooled together to estimate the combined</p>
 <p>means and SDs, (
  <i>ii</i>) if the means were significantly different, but the variances were the same among all blocks, then the mean would be estimated by averaging the block means while the SDs would be estimated by pooled residuals, and (
  <i>iii</i>) if the means and variances were significantly different among all blocks, then the means and SDs would be estimated by averaging block means and SDs. For details of our data set, see additional file 1.
