 <p>the timing of reaching the critical holin concentration in the membrane.</p>
 <p>Typically, the lysis time of a phage is estimated using a one-step growth curve [41-43]. In the case of phage λ , however, the availability of thermally-inducible 
  <i>E. coli</i> λ lysogens allows a more precise determination of the lysis time by following the decline of culture turbidity [26,44]. Direct observation of the lysis of individual λ lysogenic cells [45] confirmed that the precipitous decline of culture turbidity, commonly observed among thermallyinduced λ lysogen cultures, is a reflection of the saltatory nature of individual lysis events at the microscopic level. However, it is not clear to what extent the seemingly high synchronicity of lysis is influenced by various aspects of phage biology and host growth conditions. In this study, we used a simple experimental setup to assess how lysis time stochasticity is affected by allelic variation in the S protein, late promoter
