Gene conversion is suggested to have occurred frequently between the human L and M opsin genes [11-15] and to have played a crucial role in generating hybrids of the two genes with altered spectral sensitivities [16-18]. Even among individuals with normal color vision, the allele frequency of the L opsin gene with Ala at the site 180 instead of Ser is reported to be 30-38% in non-African populations [16-18]. Compared to humans, the incidence of color vision variation is reported to be rare in other catarrhines [19-21]. Among 744 male long-tailed macaques ( 
 <i>Macaca</i>
 <i>fascicularis</i> ) examined, only three were found to have a single L/M hybrid gene with an intermediate spectral sensitivity and to be dichromats [19,22,23]. Among 58 male chimpanzees ( 
 <i>Pan troglodytes</i> ), one was found to have an L/M hybrid gene with an intermediate spectral sensitivity in addition to one normal M opsin gene on the X chromosome and to be a protanomalous trichro-mat [21,24]. Thus, frequencies of color vision variants in male long-tailed macaques and male chimpanzees can be calculated to be ~0.4% and ~1.7%, respectively. These frequencies could be overestimated because no variants were found in 455 male monkeys from other macaque species [19,23] and because the chimpanzees examined were from limited numbers of breeding colonies [21]. Other studies have reported an absence of color vision defects in Old World monkeys and apes [20,25]. Nevertheless, gene conversion is suggested to have occurred frequently between the L and M opsin genes in non-human catarrhines on the basis of the following observations: (1) the intraspecific nucleotide divergence between the L and M opsin genes (paralogous divergence) tends to be smaller than divergence of the same gene between species (orthologous divergence) [26,27], (2) alle-lic polymorphism is often shared between L and M opsin genes and between species [28,29], (3) paralogous nucleo-tide divergence in introns and peripheral exons (exons 1 and 6) is significantly smaller than those in the centrally located exons (exons 2-5), which contain the amino acid sites affecting absorption spectra of the L and M photopig-ments [13,14]. These studies suggest that gene conversions at nucleotide sites relevant for the spectral difference between the L and M opsins have been effectively elimi-nated from the population by purifying natural selection. If gene conversion occurred frequently between the L and M opsin genes and if purifying selection was active in non-human catarrhines, we would also expect another intraspecific pattern of nucleotide variation: higher nucleotide divergence between the L and M opsin genes in central exons than in introns in addition to lower nucleotide diversity within these exons than within introns. However, the within-species nucleotide variation of both exons and introns has been evaluated for only the
