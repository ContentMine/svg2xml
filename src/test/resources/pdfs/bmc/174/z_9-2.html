 <p>degree of stochasticity [15,25,48,49]. Since CV is a composite statistic (defined as standard deviation/mean), it is sometimes difficult to discern whether an increase in the observed stochasticity (as quantified by CV) is due to decrease in mean or increase in SD. In some cases, a different metric, such as phenotypic noise strength (defined as variance/mean) [17,20], or a slight variant of it (defined as variance/squared mean) [19], has been used as well. Many times, it is not clear why a particular metric is used, except in the instance where the phenotypic noise strength is used to test against an 
  <i>a priori expectation of a Poisson distribution, for which variance/mean = 1.</i>
 </p>
 <p>It is understandable why the CV, or a variant, is used in certain situations. For example, if the means are drastically different from each other or a comparison is made between measurements using different units [[56], pp. 57-59.]. In our study, however, the means were not very different and the same measuring unit (
  <i>i.e.</i>, min) was used. Therefore, we presented our means and SDs separately and then jointly as CVs. Except in one instance where presenting stochasticity as SD or CV makes a difference (
  <i>i.e.</i>, effect of genotype on SD or CV vs. MLT), all the other results showed that SD and CV followed the same trend. Since CV can be derived from SD and mean, no information is lost by presenting them separately. Furthermore, when the stochasticity (or noise distribution) is not apparent, it may be advisable to present results as means and SDs (and if necessary, higher moments like skewness and kurtosis) separately, so that the impact of various experimental treatments on the noise distribution can be fully appreciated.
