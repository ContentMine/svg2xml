 <p>Effects of KCN Addition The energy poison potassium cyanide, KCN, has long been used in phage research to trigger premature lysis [43]. Typically, after KCN addition, culture turbidity declines precipitously [44], indicating that individual lysis events are relatively synchronous. The KCNinduced premature lysis is thought to be mediated through a collapsed proton motive force (PMF) resulting from a inhibition of the bacterial respiratory chain. As has been shown with Î» S holin, a 40% drop in the PMF</p>
