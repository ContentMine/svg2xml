 <p>Effect of Host Growth Rates In general, cells growing at a faster rate have higher concentrations of various biosynthesis machineries [53]. Since the expression of the phage holin gene is entirely dependent on the host, we hypothesized that a lower host growth rate would lead to a lower rate of holin protein synthesis, thus resulting in a longer lysis time and increased lysis time stochasticity. In the phage T4, it was shown that lysis time was negatively correlated</p>
 <p>with host growth rate [54]. We determined the MLTs and SDs for wild-type l lysogen grown in four different growth media: standard LB (lysogeny broth [55]), 20% LB, Davis minimal salts</p>
