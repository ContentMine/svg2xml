 <p>Manipulation of holin production rate In our study, we manipulated the holin production rate</p>
 <p>by manipulating the λ 
  <i>p</i>
  <sub>
   <i>R</i>
  </sub>
  <i>’ </i>activity
  <i> </i>and
  <i> </i>the
  <i> </i>lysogen growth rate. We observed that, in general, treatments expected to result in higher holin production rates (
  <i>e.g.</i>, high 
  <i>p</i>
  <sub>
   <i>R</i>
  </sub>
  <i>’ </i>activity
  <i> </i>or
  <i> </i>high
  <i> </i>lysogen
  <i> </i>growth
  <i> </i>rate)
  <i> </i>also resulted in shorter MLTs and smaller SDs (Figure 3B and 3D). Furthermore, it was surprising that the combined MLTs and SDs, despite being from two different experimental treatments, namely 
  <i>p</i>
  <sub>
   <i>R</i>
  </sub>
  <i>’ </i>activity
  <i> </i>and
  <i> </i>lysogen growth rate, showed almost identical positive correlations, even after excluding the far-flung data point with the longest MLT and largest SD (obtained with strain SYP028, see Table 2) from the analysis (Figure 3C). This result suggests that, irrespective of how the MLT was achieved, as long as the MLTs are the same, we should expect to observe similar SDs. For the wild-type λ S holin sequence, any factor that results in 1.0 min increase in MLT would be accompanied by a concomitant 0.3 min increase in the SD. It would be interesting to conduct a similar experiment with different holin sequences to see if the rate of SD increase is sequence-

 <p>specific. Regarding the effects of host growth rate on lysis time stochasticity, it is interesting to note the following. Amir et al. [10]
  <i> </i>found
  <i> </i>that
  <i> </i>the
  <i> </i>MLTs,
  <i> </i>SDs,
  <i> </i>and
  <i> </i>CVs,
  <i> </i>following UV induction, ranged from 72 min, 9 min, and 12.5% respectively for λ lysogens alone to 99 min, 14 min, and 14.1% respectively for λ lysogens carrying pRGFP reporter plasmid and 117 min, 19 min, and 15.8% respectively for λ lysogens carrying pR’ -tR’ -GFP reporter plasmid (all values are extracted from their figures six A and B). Since their λ lysogens were grown in M9 minimal salts medium plus various growth factors and 0.4% glucose at 37°C, it is similar to our Davis minimal salts medium with glucose, from which we obtained the comparable values of 70.3 min, 6.3 min, and 8.96% respectively (see Table 2). It is not clear whether the difference between these two SDs is the result of different methods used for lysogen induction (thermal vs. UV induction) or different growth media, but the MLTs are virtually identical. Their result also indirectly confirmed
